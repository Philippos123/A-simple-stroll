## Depoloyment

I deployd this project to Heroku 

1. I logged in to Heroku
2. Created new app
3. Named my app and picked my region 
4. Then i linked the heroku app to my repo in github and loaded it. 


## Bugs 
 I found a couple bugs where the player would put in 3 when there only was 1 or 2 as an option wich would create an infinite loop. 
 The other bug i found was when i created else statments but didn't pass in the variable from the function wich made it crash.
